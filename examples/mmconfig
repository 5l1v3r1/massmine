## mmconfig
##
## Example configuration file for massmine. MassMine will find this
## file automatically when it runs. Instead of relying on this, you
## should edit a copy of this file to include your twitter account
## information (application names, keys, and secrets). Place that
## edited copy in a folder of your choice, and then point to the file
## when you run massmine (see www.massmine.org for more info) by using
## the following syntax

## massmine /path/to/mmconfig

## Lines in this file beginning with # will be ignored by MassMine, so
## you are welcome and encouraged to make notes for yourself.  The
## remaining lines below that do NOT begin with # must be manually
## edited. Instructions for each line are given below. This
## configuration file uses YAML structuring. See www.massmine.org for
## more information.
